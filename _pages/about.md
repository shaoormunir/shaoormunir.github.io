I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of California, Davis, under the guidance of [Professor Zubair Shafiq](https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~zubair/index.html). My research is focused on enhancing online privacy for users worldwide by employing advanced machine learning and data analytics techniques.
