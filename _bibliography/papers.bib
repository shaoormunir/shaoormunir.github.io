    abstract = "Given the potential misuse of recent advances in synthetic text generation by language models (LMs), it is important to have the capacity to attribute authorship of synthetic text. While stylometric organic (i.e., human written) authorship attribution has been quite successful, it is unclear whether similar approaches can be used to attribute a synthetic text to its source LM. We address this question with the key insight that synthetic texts carry subtle distinguishing marks inherited from their source LM and that these marks can be leveraged by machine learning (ML) algorithms for attribution. We propose and test several ML-based attribution methods. Our best attributor built using a fine-tuned version of XLNet (XLNet-FT) consistently achieves excellent accuracy scores (91{\%} to near perfect 98{\%}) in terms of attributing the parent pre-trained LM behind a synthetic text. Our experiments show promising results across a range of experiments where the synthetic text may be generated using pre-trained LMs, fine-tuned LMs, or by varying text generation parameters.",

abstract = {As third-party cookie blocking is becoming the norm in mainstream web browsers, advertisers and trackers have started to use first-party cookies for tracking. To understand this phenomenon, we conduct a differential measurement study with versus without third-party cookies. We find that first-party cookies are used to store and exfiltrate identifiers to known trackers even when third-party cookies are blocked.As opposed to third-party cookie blocking, first-party cookie blocking is not practical because it would result in major breakage of website functionality. We propose CookieGraph, a machine learning-based approach that can accurately and robustly detect and block first-party tracking cookies. CookieGraph detects first-party tracking cookies with 90.18\% accuracy, outperforming the state-of-the-art CookieBlock by 17.31\%. We show that CookieGraph is robust against cookie name manipulation, while CookieBlock's accuracy drops by 15.87\%. While blocking all first-party cookies results in major breakage on 32\% of the sites with SSO logins, and CookieBlock reduces it to 10\%, we show that CookieGraph does not cause any major breakage on these sites.Our deployment of CookieGraph shows that first-party tracking cookies are used on 89.86\% of the top-million websites. We find that 96.61\% of these first-party tracking cookies are in fact ghostwritten by third-party scripts embedded in the first-party context. We also find evidence of first-party tracking cookies being set by fingerprinting scripts. The most prevalent first-party tracking cookies are set by major advertising entities such as Google, Facebook, and TikTok.},
